# Mpemba-Effect-Case-study
Documentation (including code used) for my self-designed Experiment

The Mpemba Effect states: under certain circumstances, given 2 samples of water varying only in their initial temperature, the sample with higher initial temperature will, counterintuitively, reaching freezing before other sample

Skills gained:
-    Designing and conducting an experiment with the help of electronics and automated scripts
-    Interpreting raw sensory data from 5 temperature probes for over 100 trials using C scripts
-    Formatting data into a form more accessible for statistical analysis using Python scripts 
-    Using Python and statistical tool such as averages, standard deviations and regression values to find correlations and determine their significance   
-    Using Python libraries to graph the data to be easily understood 

-    Writing 22 page follow-up report outlining the procedure and findings along with conclusion on the significance of the findings
